Closely connected to the innovative artistic genre Cubism, ...Gris was born in Madrid and later studied engineering at the Madrid School of Arts and Sciences. There, from 1902 to 1904, he contributed drawings to local periodicals. From 1904 to 1905, he studied painting with the academic artist José Moreno Carbonero. It was in 1905 that José Victoriano González adopted the more distinctive name Juan Gris. The three lived at the Bateau-Lavoir, 13 Rue Ravignan, Paris, from 1909 to 1911. In 1912 Gris met Charlotte Augusta Fernande Herpin (1894–1983), also known as Josette. Late 1913 or early 1914 they lived together at the Bateau-Lavoir until 1922. Josette Gris was Juan Gris\\' second companion and unofficial wife. Gris began to paint seriously in 1911 (when he gave up working as a satirical cartoonist), developing at this time a personal Cubist style. In A Life of Picasso, John Richardson writes that Jean Metzinger\\'s 1911 work, Le goûter (Tea Time), persuaded Juan Gris of the importance of mathematics in painting.

There, from 1902 to 1904, he contributed drawings to local periodicals. From 1904 to 1905, he studied painting with the academic artist José Moreno Carbonero. It was in 1905 that José Victoriano González adopted the more distinctive name Juan Gris.[2]\\nIn 1909, Lucie Belin (1891–1942)—Gris\\' wife—gave birth to Georges Gonzalez-Gris (1909–2003), the artist\\'s only child. The three lived at the Bateau-Lavoir, 13 Rue Ravignan, Paris, from 1909 to 1911. In 1912 Gris met Charlotte Augusta Fernande Herpin (1894–1983), also known as Josette. Late 1913 or early 1914 they lived together at the Bateau-Lavoir until 1922. Josette Gris was Juan Gris\\' second companion and unofficial wife.[3][4]\\n\\nCareer[edit]\\nEl 1 de mayo en el Kursall. Illustration published in the magazine ¡Alegría!\\xa0[es], Madrid 1907\\nIn 1906, after he sold all his possessions,[5] he moved to Paris and became friends with the poets Guillaume Apollinaire, Max Jacob, and artists Henri Matisse, Georges Braque, Fernand Léger and Jean Metzinger.[6][7] He submitted darkly humorous illustrations to journals such as the anarchist satirical magazine L\\'Assiette au Beurre, and also Le Rire, Le Charivari, and Le Cri de Paris.[8] In Paris, Gris followed the lead of Metzinger and another friend and fellow countryman, Pablo Picasso.\\nGris began to paint seriously in 1911 (when he gave up working as a satirical cartoonist), developing at this time a personal Cubist style.[9] In A Life of Picasso, John Richardson writes that Jean Metzinger\\'s 1911 work, Le goûter (Tea Time), persuaded Juan Gris of the importance of mathematics in painting.[10] Gris exhibited for the first time at the 1912 Salon des Indépendants (a painting entitled Hommage à Pablo Picasso).[9]\\n\"He appears with two styles\", writes art historian Peter Brooke, \"In one of them a grid structure appears that is clearly reminiscent of the Goûter and of Metzinger\\'s later work in 1912.\"[9] In the other, Brooke continues, \"the grid is still present but the lines are not stated and their continuity is broken. Their presence is suggested by the heavy, often triangular, shading of the angles between them... Both styles are distinguished from the work of Picasso and Braque by their clear, rational and measurable quality.\"[9] Although Gris regarded Picasso as a teacher, Gertrude Stein wrote in The Autobiography of Alice B. Toklas that \"Juan Gris was the only person whom Picasso wished away\".[11]\\n\\nPortrait of Picasso, 1912, oil on canvas, the Art Institute of Chicago\\nIn 1912, Gris exhibited at the Exposició d\\'art cubista, Galeries Dalmau in Barcelona, the first declared group exhibition of Cubism worldwide;[12][13] the gallery Der Sturm in Berlin; the Salon de la Société Normande de Peinture Moderne in Rouen; and the Salon de la Section d\\'Or in Paris. Gris, in that same year, signed a contract that gave Daniel-Henry Kahnweiler exclusive rights to his work.[14]\\nAt first Gris painted in the style of Analytical Cubism, a term he himself later coined,[15] but after 1913 he began his conversion to Synthetic Cubism, of which he became a steadfast interpreter, with extensive use of papier collé or, collage. Unlike Picasso and Braque, whose Cubist works were practically monochromatic, Gris painted with bright harmonious colors in daring, novel combinations in the manner of his friend Matisse. Gris exhibited with the painters of the Puteaux Group in the Salon de la Section d\\'Or in 1912.[16] His preference for clarity and order influenced the Purist style of Amédée Ozenfant and Charles Edouard Jeanneret (Le Corbusier), and made Gris an important exemplar of the post-war \"return to order\" movement.[17] In 1915 he was painted by his friend, Amedeo Modigliani. In November 1917 he made one of his few sculptures, the polychrome plaster Harlequin.[18][19]\\n\\nCrystal Cubism[edit]\\nMain article: Crystal Cubism\\nJuan Gris, September 1916, Woman with Mandolin, after Corot (La femme à la mandoline, d\\'après Corot), oil on canvas, 92 x 60 cm, Kunstmuseum Basel\\nJuan Gris, 1915, Still Life before an Open Window, Place Ravignan, oil on canvas, 115.9 x 88.9 cm, Philadelphia Museum of Art\\nGris\\'s works from late 1916 through 1917 exhibit a greater simplification of geometric structure, a blurring of the distinction between objects and setting, between subject matter and background. The oblique overlapping planar constructions, tending away from equilibrium, can best be seen in Woman with Mandolin, after Corot (September 1916) and in its epilogue, Portrait of Josette Gris (October 1916; Museo Reina Sofia).[20]\\nThe clear-cut underlying geometric framework of these works seemingly controls the finer elements of the compositions; the constituent components, including the small planes of the faces, become part of the unified whole. Though Gris certainly had planned the representation of his chosen subject matter, the abstract armature serves as the starting point.[20]\\nThe geometric structure of Juan Gris\\'s Crystal period is already palpable in Still Life before an Open Window, Place Ravignan (June 1915; Philadelphia Museum of Art). The overlapping elemental planar structure of the composition serves as a foundation to flatten the individual elements onto a unifying surface, foretelling the shape of things to come.\\nIn 1919 and particularly 1920, artists and critics began to write conspicuously about this \\'synthetic\\' approach, and to assert its importance in the overall scheme of advanced Cubism.[20]\\n\\nDesigner and theorist[edit]\\nIn 1924, he designed ballet sets and costumes for Sergei Diaghilev and the famous Ballets Russes.[21]\\nGris articulated most of his aesthetic theories during 1924 and 1925. He delivered his definitive lecture, Des possibilités de la peinture, at the Sorbonne in 1924.[6] Major Gris exhibitions took place at the Galerie Simon in Paris and the Galerie Flechtheim in Berlin in 1923 and at the Galerie Flechtheim in Düsseldorf in 1925.[22]\\n\\nDeath[edit]\\nAfter October 1925, Gris was frequently ill with bouts of uremia and cardiac problems. He died of kidney failure[23] in Boulogne-sur-Seine (Paris) on 11 May 1927, at the age of 40, leaving a wife, Josette, and a son, Georges.\\n\\nArt market[edit]\\nJuan Gris, Nature morte à la nappe à carreaux (Still Life with Checkered Tablecloth), 1915, oil on canvas, 116.5 x 89.3 cm, Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York\\nThe top auction price for a Gris work is $57.1\\xa0million (£34.8\\xa0million), achieved for his 1915 painting Nature morte à la nappe à carreaux (Still Life with Checked Tablecloth).[24] This surpassed previous records of $20.8\\xa0million for his 1915 still life Livre, pipe et verres,  $28.6\\xa0million for the 1913 artwork Violon et guitare [25] and $31.8 million for The musician\\'s table, now in the Met.[26]\\n\\nSelected works[edit]\\nViolin Hanging on a Wall (Le violon accroché), (1913).

He moved to Paris in 1906 and settled at the Bateau-Lavoir, an artists’ dwelling where his compatriot Pablo Picasso lived. Gris was thus in touch with the evolution of Cubism, a style initiated by Picasso and Georges Braque around 1907. Gris executed his first serious paintings in 1910 and adopted the Cubist style the following year. In 1912 the prominent art dealer Daniel-Henry Kahnweiler agreed to purchase his entire artistic output.\\n\\n\\nBritannica Quiz\\nUltimate Art Quiz\\n\\n\\nThe Breakfast Table, oil and charcoal on canvas by Juan Gris, 1915; in the National Museum of Modern Art, Paris.In 1912 Picasso and Braque abandoned their abstract analyses of form and began to synthesize images from found shapes and textures, a style that is referred to as Synthetic Cubism. The following year Gris arrived at his own personal and mature version of Synthetic Cubism. His works are characterized by rigorously geometric compositions in which fragmented objects and sharp-edged planes are articulated with maximum clarity. A more theoretical painter than Picasso or Braque, Gris systematized their discoveries, making their intuitions comprehensible and, consequently, helping to spread the Cubist style. His version of Cubism was more severe and classical, and less spontaneous, than theirs. Between 1921 and 1927, however, Gris transformed his Synthetic Cubist idiom so that his style became increasingly free and lyrical.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\"},\n",

Gris was born in 1887 in Madrid, where he later studied engineering from 1902 to 1904. Gradually, he started to shift his attention to drawing and began creating illustrations for local periodicals. In 1906, Gris moved to Paris, to the Montmartre neighborhood, where he met Pablo Picasso, who introduced him to the leading avant-garde artists, poets, and critics of the time: George Braque, Guillaume Apollinaire, Gertrude Stein, Max Jacob, and Pierre Reverdy. Gris worked as a graphic artist, creating drawings for political and satirical magazines. Influenced by his environment, he started to pursue painting seriously in 1911. He made his artistic debut in the 1912 Salon of Independent Artists with The Portrait of Pablo Picasso (1912), a painting that is considered one of the finest examples of Cubist portraiture.In 1913, under the influence of Picasso and Braque, Gris began to experiment with collage and, more specifically,  papier collé (cut and pasted paper). Through these artistic experiments, Gris contributed to the development of Synthetic Cubism – a later phase of Cubism that emphasized the flat quality of the image. Gris’s style was characterized by the structured geometric compositions that presented fragmented objects and overlapping planes. This style was encompassed in paintings like Still Life before an Open Window, Place Ravignan (1915), and Newspaper and Fruit Dish (1916). In comparison to Braque and Picasso, Gris had a more theoretical approach that resulted in more austere and organized compositions. From 1916 onward, he turned his attention to painting figures, creating more distilled compositions with more simplified geometric structures, like Portrait of Madame Josette Gris (1916) and Seated Woman (1917). In both portraits, the artist flattened the image, almost eliminating the distinction between the subject matter and the background.Throughout World War I, Gris worked in Paris. After the war, he had his first major solo exhibition at Rosenberg’s Galerie l’Effort Moderne in Paris in 1919. Gris’s health began to deteriorate in 1922, and he moved to Boulogne-sur-Seine in the Western suburbs of Paris. Between 1922 and 1924, Gris designed stage sets and costumes for Sergei Diaghilev’s ballets, Les Tentations de la Bergère, and La Colombe. During this period, he also wrote essays that explained his aesthetic theories. In 1924, Gris delivered the lecture “Des possibilités de la Peinture” (The Possibilities of Painting) at the Sorbonne in Paris. Some of his major exhibitions include the 1923 shows at the Galerie Simon in Paris and the Galerie Flechtheim in Berlin and the 1925 show at the Galerie Flechtheim in Düsseldorf. Gris died from kidney failure on May 11, 1927, at his home in Boulogne-sur-Seine. He was only 40 years old.\\nMore ...\\n\\n\\nJosé Victoriano (Carmelo Carlos) González-Pérez (March 23, 1887 – May 11, 1927), better known as Juan Gris (Spanish:\\xa0[ˈxwan ˈɡɾis]; French:\\xa0[gʀi]), was a Spanish painter and sculptor born in Madrid who lived and worked in France most of his life. Closely connected to the innovative artistic genre Cubism, his works are among the movement\\'s most distinctive.\\r Gris was born in Madrid. He later studied engineering at Madrid\\'s School of Arts and Sciences. There, from 1902 to 1904, he contributed drawings to local periodicals. From 1904 to 1905, he studied painting with the academic artist José Moreno Carbonero. It was in 1905 that José Victoriano González adopted the more distinctive name Juan Gris.\\r In 1906 he moved to Paris and became friends with Henri Matisse, Georges Braque and Fernand Léger. In Paris, Gris followed the lead of another friend and fellow countryman, Pablo Picasso. He submitted darkly humorous illustrations to journals such as the anarchist satirical magazine L\\'Assiette au Beurre, and also Le Rire, Le Charivari, and Le Cri de Paris.\\r Gris began to paint seriously in 1910 (when he gave up working as a satirical cartoonist), developing at this time a personal Cubist style. In A Life of Picasso, John Richardson writes that Jean Metzinger\\'s 1911 work, Le goûter (Tea Time), persuaded Juan Gris of the importance of mathematics in painting. Gris exhibited for the first time at the 1912 Salon des Indépendants (a painting entitled Hommage à Pablo Picasso).\\r \"He appears with two styles\", writes art historian Peter Brooke, \"In one of them a grid structure appears that is clearly reminiscent of the Goûter and of Metzinger\\'s later work in 1912.\" In the other, Brooke continues, \"the grid is still present but the lines are not stated and their continuity is broken. Their presence is suggested by the heavy, often triangular, shading of the angles between them... Both styles are distinguished from the work of Picasso and Braque by their clear, rational and measurable quality.\" Although Gris regarded Picasso as a teacher, Gertrude Stein wrote in The Autobiography of Alice B. Toklas that \"Juan Gris was the only person whom Picasso wished away\".\\r In 1912 Gris exhibited at the Exposicío d\\'art cubista, galeríes J. Dalmau in Barcelona; the gallery Der Sturm in Berlin; the Salon de la Société Normande de Peinture Moderne in Rouen; and the Salon de la Section d\\'Or in Paris. Gris, in that same year, signed a contract that gave D.-H. Kahnweiler exclusive rights to his work.\\r At first Gris painted in the style of Analytical Cubism, a term he himself later coined, but after 1913 he began his conversion to Synthetic Cubism, of which he became a steadfast interpreter, with extensive use of papier collé or, collage. Unlike Picasso and Braque, whose Cubist works were practically monochromatic, Gris painted with bright harmonious colors in daring, novel combinations in the manner of his friend Matisse. Gris exhibited with the painters of the Puteaux Group in the Salon de la Section d\\'Or in 1912. His preference for clarity and order influenced the Purist style of Amédée Ozenfant and Charles Edouard Jeanneret (Le Corbusier), and made Gris an important exemplar of the post-war \"return to order\" movement. In 1915 he was painted by his friend, Amedeo Modigliani. In November 1917 he made one of his few sculptures, the polychrome plaster Harlequin.\\n\\n                                    This is a part of the Wikipedia article used under the Creative Commons Attribution-Sharealike 3.0 Unported License (CC-BY-SA).

Three of the movement’s leading artists—Pablo Picasso, Georges Braque, and Juan Gris—began to incorporate items such as newspaper, wallpaper, and other commercially printed and found objects into their Cubist works.\\nAt the time, this shocking combination of ‘real’ things into works of art further challenged ideas about illusionistic rendering and what materials might be considered appropriate for making art.\\nIn 1914, Gris made a series of dynamic and intriguing still-life compositions that display his mastery of the form. A virtuoso at manipulating materials, Gris made formally and technically complex works by layering his carefully selected papers—piecing together intersecting shapes, textures, patterns, and colors—and using paints, pencils, and crayons to play sophisticated visual games.\\nThrough these unorthodox materials and techniques, Gris tested the viewer’s comprehension of space, depth, light, and shadow.\\nAt times the spatial relationships in Gris’s collages are undecipherable, making it difficult to find a surface on which to rest the eye. They can give the sense that one is walking around and surveying the scene from all angles at once, creating a kind of simultaneity of seeing that relies on the brain to put together the disjointed and fractionalized images.\\n\\nHis works embrace a totality of vision, capturing both the physical and ephemeral at once—a tenet of Cubist theory.\\nOne of the most exciting aspects of these works is the array of papers Gris used in his collages, many of which had inherent cultural connotations. These included newspapers, wallpapers, fine art papers, book pages, tracing papers, and packaging and labels for tobacco, coffee and liquor. Several of these types of paper can be seen pieced together here in\\xa0Cup, Glasses, and Bottle (1914).\\nMany of the wallpapers found in the Cubist era were designed to mimic decorative surfaces such as wood paneling, marble, stone, and woven fabrics, as well as architectural details.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWallpaper manufacturers imitated surfaces, exploiting aspects of the printing process to disguise the uniformity inherent in mass production to yield a “natural” appearance. These include:\\nRandom ink puckering to imitate marble — faux marbre\\nDrips and ink bleeding to imitate stone or granite — granité\\nPatterning with many small variable marks to create a wood-grain — faux bois\\nSuch seemingly haphazard effects help to create the illusion of marble, stone, and wood rather than betray their true materials—ink on paper.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nGris also used wallpaper patterns popular in his time, including florals and stripes, and novelty papers such as those depicting woven materials or Venetian blinds, which are visible here in The Sunblind (1914).\\nThe use of the mixture of artists’ and non-artists’ papers adds visual and interpretative complexity. The wallpapers are a stunning addition, as Gris chose those that are made to fool the eye. He used them in ways that both gave meaning to his collages, signifying certain materials or objects, but also provided for multiple interpretations.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nGris’s collages also rely heavily on painted and drawn elements. Conté crayon was one of his favorite media. Gris rendered his still-life objects primarily with traditional shaded modeling, as seen here in Book and Glass (1914).\\nThe drawn book is superimposed on a geometric pattern drawn with the same black conté crayon, creating a visual contradiction; the paper is flat, while at the same time the outline and shadows of the book and the manipulations of the drawn pattern create an illusion of volume.\\nThis effect is complicated by the depiction of the pipe (above) and the printed collaged book (to the right), which appears tucked under the geometric passages.\\nGris gave the collaged book a suggestion of volume by pasting together multiple pages of the text block along the lower edge.\\nStaccato marks of black conté crayon provide the effect of smoky shadow.\\nBlack paint articulates deep areas void of light.\\nWhite gouache defines the light-struck areas and picks out features that reflect light.\\nThis trio of materials in black and white is essential to Gris’s collage works and can be found in most of them.\\nThrough his use of crayon, charcoal, and gouache, Gris showed that he was able to render volumetric forms through light and shadow, employing techniques that have been used for centuries to render illusionistic space, and heightening the tension by situating illusionistic space in otherwise flattened and disjointed work.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Musician’s Table (1914) offers a clear demonstration of these techniques and how, with great precision and attention to detail, Gris created complex puzzles of textures and patterns.\\nThis work alone contains six types of paper: two kinds of wallpaper, transparentized paper, newspaper, and two colors of laid paper, as well as four different applied media: conté crayon, gouache, oil paint, and blue pencil.\\nHis treatment of newspaper shows an understanding of the material and how it interacts with others.\\nThe corner of the newspaper intrudes into the blue field but does not overlap the laid paper. Instead, Gris cut out a space for it, accounting for the fact that otherwise the laid paper would impart its texture onto the thin newspaper.\\nAdditionally, this passage of newspaper is not taken from a single front page but rather cleverly composed of three pieces.\\nThrough the center, Gris seamed together two headlines nearly invisibly to invent his desired story.\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\nHe also tucked an additional page under the top sheet that sticks out along the bottom and right side.\\nThis detail gives the illusion that the newspaper is a multipage object capable of casting shadows, which Gris rendered with black paint and conté crayon.\\nThe bright blue paper is typical of Gris’s collages, which are bold and colorful in nature.\\nThe pronounced text of this laid paper readily produces graduated shadows when drawn upon, an effect that is beautifully illustrated in the area where Gris drew the intricate head of the stringed instrument using conté crayon.\\nIn the center of this composition, Gris applied a faux bois wallpaper printed in brown ink, with the grain running horizontally.\\nIn this case, wood grain can signify a variety of items including the wooden table, the wood floor, wood paneling on the wall or even faux bois wallpaper on the walls. Threads of ambiguity like this are left in many areas.\\nThe pieces are masterfully cut, likely with a straight edge. This creates smooth surfaces that can at times appear seamless, allowing shapes, patters, and colors to blend in novel ways.\\nAs in most of his collages, Gris used black media at the intersections of the various papers in order to disguise the junctures and create the illusion of seamlessness.\\nIn several places, Gris made a change or correction by adhering a patch of the brown-printed paper to the surface with an incredible amount of care. If it’s difficult to find where he did so, it’s because he lined up the pattern to make the seams almost invisible.\\nThis technique is akin to the methods used to create the illusion of seamlessness in wood marquetry and wallpapered rooms.\\nThe other faux bois wallpaper in this collage has a prominent pinstripe pattern and is oriented on the diagonal.\\nUpon close observation of this paper, on which details of the violin are drawn, one detects the wood-grain pattern, printed in red.\\nIt is not surprising that Gris chose this paper to form the parts of the violin, as its similarities in color and prominent striation pattern to an actual violin are remarkable.\\n\\n\\xa0\\nMaker: Antonio Stradivari (Italian, 1644–1737). “The Antonius” Violin.

Bequest of Annie Bolton Matthews Bryant, 1933 (34.86.1a)\\nThe pattern may be difficult to discern because it’s been obscured by both the darkening of the paper and the fading of the ink. This is an important consideration when looking at Gris’s collages or any work of art, particularly those with paper components.\\nOver time, the environment a work is kept in and the inherent characteristics of its materials can change its appearance. In Flowers (1914), for example, what were once vivid roses are now almost difficult to discern and the newspapers have darkened significantly.\\n\\nJuan Gris (Spanish, 1887–1927). Flowers, 1914.

Lauder, 2021 (2021.395.3)\\nThe degree of change is caused by many factors and can result in the works having fewer bright colors and less contrast overall, suggesting that Gris’s collages originally may have had the bright chromatic range seen in his paintings.\\n\\nJuan Gris (Spanish, 1887–1927).

Lauder Cubist Collection\\nGris also created a clever and beautiful solution for depicting glass in his works.\\nIn The Musician’s Table, he placed a layer of transparentized paper, somewhat like wax or tracing paper, on the forms of the bottles and drinking glasses. This paper is a simulacrum for glass, mimicking its ability to reflect light and transmit images. He has captured the visual essence of liquid and glass in both smooth bottles and faceted glassware.\\nFor the central glass, he laid the transparentized paper over the wallpaper and the white laid paper, and then enhanced its forms with small strokes of white and gray paint and black conté crayon.\\nThe glass at the top is made from a piece of the brown-printed faux bois wallpaper with the grain oriented diagonally. The change in grain orientation and the color modulation caused by the transparentized paper simulate the shifts in the way we perceive glass objects as light moves through them.\\nThe bottle on the left side of the composition is also defined by a piece of the transparentized paper. Beneath this layer the liquid is articulated with white laid paper while the empty part of the bottle is signified by allowing the blue laid paper to show through.\\nIn any such bottle, light reflecting off the surface of the liquid within can produce a circle or oval that appears opaque. Gris simulates this effect of liquid and air meeting by defining an oval on the white laid paper with a green-blue wax crayon.\\n\\xa0Drawn elements in black, white, and blue-green often form the color scheme in Gris’s depictions of glass.\\nHe was able to give solidity to intangible entities such as light and shadow by imbuing them with the form and weight of paper and opaque media, fulfilling his goal to “try to make concrete that which is abstract.” (L’Esprit Nouveau, no. 5)\\nGris understood the full effect of mixing flat, patterned papers with volumetric elements, and he exploited his materials to achieve maximum ambiguity.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe complexity and precision of Gris’s collages distinguish them from the works of his fellow Cubists. Bottle of Rosé Wine (1914) illustrates how the abutting, intersecting, and overlapping papers and media in his works create dynamic, abstract compositions that include traditionally rendered objects, but are difficult to reconcile spatially.\\nHis smooth surfaces composed of various paper types, patterns, and textures are akin to traditional trompe l’oeil paintings in their meticulous attention to detail, but they also display the modern sensibility of a photomontage, in which an uninterrupted surface unifies disconnected entities.\\nGris’s intricate visual games explore the nature and limits of human perception. Extending a tradition that artists have participated in for thousands of years, these clever renditions fool the eye and challenge viewers to delight in discovery.\\nHis collages simultaneously mimic reality and flaunt their fakeness, exemplifying the contradictions and tensions that were essential to Modernism’s break with the past. Through his masterful combination of high-end artists’ materials with manufactured products, Gris created rich and indisputably modern works of art.\\nCredits\\nJuan Gris (Spanish, 1887–1927).

A member of the tight-knit circle of avant-garde artists working in Paris, Gris adopted the radically fragmented picture spaces of Pablo Picasso and Georges Braque, imparting to his works a bold, graphic look. The man who would become Juan Gris, one of the leading figures in Cubist painting, was born José Victoriano Carmelo Carlos González-Pérez in Madrid in 1887. The thirteenth of fourteen children, he attended Madrid\\'s Escuela de Artes y Manufacturas from 1902 to 1904, where he studied mathematics, physics, and mechanical drawing. It was in 1905, while working under Carbonero, that González-Pérez changed his name to Juan Gris. He sold all his possessions and moved to Paris in 1906, shortly after the death of his father, and would remain in the city for much of his life. However, since he had dodged Spain\\'s obligatory military service, he had no passport and could neither leave France nor return to Spain. Following in the footsteps of Picasso and Braque, he initially worked in the style that would be later defined as Analytic Cubism, known for its monochromatic color, use of linear grids, and breaking down of a subject into geometric planes. While he clearly had enormous respect for Picasso, the older man may have been threatened by the younger\\'s talents, or simply annoyed by his flattery, leading Stein to note that, \"Juan Gris was the only person whom Picasso wished away.\"',\n",

A member of the tight-knit circle of avant-garde artists working in Paris, Gris adopted the radically fragmented picture spaces of Pablo Picasso and Georges Braque, imparting to his works a bold, graphic look. Gris\\'s paintings are immediately distinguishable from theirs, informed by his background as an illustrator, with a slick, almost commercial appearance, and crisp design elements throughout. Accomplishments Whereas Picasso and Braque delighted in destroying the conventions of painting, Gris\\'s chief aim was to please the eye. As the artist himself put it, \"I prefer the emotion that corrects the rule\". Despite his radical treatment of the picture space, his well-balanced compositions, saturated colors, and traditional subjects popularized the avant-garde movement.Like Picasso and Braque, he incorporated newsprint and advertisements into his work. Whereas they tended to snip these elements into smithereens, however, he leaves more of the original pieces of ads and newsprint intact, as if to preserve the integrity of the originals. In lifting popular culture into the realm of high art, he is an important forerunner of Dada and Pop artists, among them Marcel Duchamp, Stuart Davis, and Andy Warhol.He was among the visionaries (poets, choreographers, musicians and visual artists) who built pathways among the arts. His costumes for the Ballet Russes show his commitment to interdisciplinary collaboration, an idea that gathered momentum and became central to contemporary art. Important Art by Juan Gris\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tProgression of Art1912Portrait of PicassoGris idolized Picasso. A clever tribute to his mentor, his portrait depicts Picasso (founder of Cubism) in the Cubist style. Palette at the ready, Picasso is literally larger than life (taking up most of the space on the canvas). Working primarily in cool hues of blue, gray, and brown, he fractures the sitter\\'s face into a prism of planes and geometric shapes that resolve into the parallel lines in the background. All parts of this picture seem to be in motion. While he and his fellow practitioners produced many more chaotic images, elements of formal portraiture, such as the legibility of the sitter\\'s features, symmetry of the pose, and high-collared jacket (as opposed to a painter\\'s smock), indicate his respect for the subject. It is entirely in keeping with the Cubist mission, however, in its divergence from traditional representation and effort to capture the dynamism of modern life. Oil on Canvas - The Art Institute of Chicago\\t\\t\\t\\t1914FlowersAround this time, Gris and other Cubists began incorporating collage elements, such as newspaper and wallpaper, into their paintings. Flowers represents a woman\\'s marble-topped vanity table with a vase of roses, a coffee cup, and the morning paper. A tilting oval mirror reflects wallpaper printed with stylized Art Nouveau orchids. Newspaper and wallpaper (literal scraps of everyday life) force us to consider the subject through the lens of modernity. Gris was particularly fond of rewarding close viewers with hidden messages. Upon close inspection, we glimpse a second coffee cup and pipe camouflaged by the table - evidence that the lady is not alone. Crayon, Oil, Gouache, Wallpaper, Woven Paper, and Newspaper on Canvas - The Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York\\t\\t\\t\\t1915Still Life with Checkered TableclothThink of this painting as the masculine compliment to Flowers. Here, a small bistro table with a checked tablecloth almost overflows with an assortment of objects: a bottle of red wine, bunch of grapes, coffee cups, beer bottle, a stout ceramic pot of preserves, coasters, and a French newspaper. Like Flowers, it too contains a hidden message, this time, in reference to his native Spain: a bull\\'s head. The snout is the coffee cup toward the bottom of the canvas, the ear is the bottle of Bass ale to the right, and the \"bull\\'s eye\" is the black-and-white coaster to the left. It is a poignant reminder that the artist\\'s homeland remained on his mind, though he would never be able to return there. Flagrantly breaking the rules, and combining \"low art\" (design elements such as the beer bottle logo and newspaper typography) with \"high art\" (the traditional still life elements), Still Life with Checkered Tablecloth illustrates his brilliance in furthering the goal of Cubism: making something new out of the connections between life and art. Oil and Graphite on Canvas - The Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York\\t\\t\\t\\t1918The Man from TouraineA return to traditional values, subjects, and forms is reflected in Gris\\'s work after 1918, and is typical of avant-garde painting in general in the years after World War I. From summer through fall of 1918, he temporarily relocated to Touraine, the countryside region where his wife, Josette, had grown up, and painted peasants in the traditional clothing of the region. Rather than a specific individual, the old peasant in this scene is an archetypal resident of the area. More somber in tone than many of his preceding works in the Synthetic Cubist mode, and simpler, limited to a figure and some objects arranged in two distinct planes, his representation of a farmer expresses a nostalgic mood and a yearning for an enduring, traditional way of life in a chaotic and uncertain time. Oil on Canvas - Pompidou Centre, Paris\\t\\t\\t\\t1918Harlequin with a GuitarA favorite of Picasso and other modernists who reexamined traditional sources after the war, Harlequin was a stock character in the commedia dell\\'arte (a form of masked theater that originated in 16th-century Italy) and a trickster figure with a tendency to act on whim and passion. Harlequin, a time-honored subject in art, appears in approximately 40 of his works produced between 1917 and 1925. Here, his background as an illustrator is visible in the cartoonish eyes and mouth, and the bright graphic lines that trace the figure and its costume. Warm color tones and a familiar subject lend the piece a reassuring stability, undermined somewhat by the slippage in details such as the knotholes, which appear to sliding off the table, and the fingers of Harlequin\\'s right hand, which double as the contour of the guitar. Oil on Panel - The Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York\\t\\t\\t\\t1927Woman with a BasketGris\\'s mysterious painting is of a woman holding a woven basket of vegetables in front of an oval window or mirror. The styling of her hair, face, and clothing recalls Greek and Roman depictions of women, illustrating the renewed interest in classicism and traditional representation of form among European painters after World War I. Like Harlequin and The Man from Touraine, she is a generalized type rather than an individual, perhaps a harvest goddess or an artist\\'s muse. The basket she holds, an element of still-life, recalls his earlier paintings. The hidden message here is less obvious, and yet all the more compelling: the oval behind the figure (either a window or a mirror) is dark, suggesting the approach of death. The piece, one of his strongest and best-known, shows that he remained at the height of his power until the end of his career. Oil on Canvas - Private Collection\\t\\t\\t\\tBiography of Juan GrisChildhood The man who would become Juan Gris, one of the leading figures in Cubist painting, was born José Victoriano Carmelo Carlos González-Pérez in Madrid in 1887. The thirteenth of fourteen children, he attended Madrid\\'s Escuela de Artes y Manufacturas from 1902 to 1904, where he studied mathematics, physics, and mechanical drawing. Though he was a strong student, the rigidity of academic life did not appeal to him, and his natural ability in drawing encouraged him to shift his focus to the study of art.Early Training After leaving school, he studied painting under the tutelage of José Moreno Carbonero, a respected and sucessful artist in Madrid who had himself taught Salvador Dalí and Picasso. It was in 1905, while working under Carbonero, that González-Pérez changed his name to Juan Gris. He sold all his possessions and moved to Paris in 1906, shortly after the death of his father, and would remain in the city for much of his life. However, since he had dodged Spain\\'s obligatory military service, he had no passport and could neither leave France nor return to Spain.During his early years in Paris, he worked as an illustrator and satirical cartoonist for a variety of magazines and periodicals. He settled in the Montmartre artist commune Bateau Lavoir, where he met Picasso, Braque, Matisse, and the American writer Gertrude Stein, who would become a lifelong admirer and collector of his work. As he developed relationships with fellow artists, he began to devote more energy to his own painting. Following in the footsteps of Picasso and Braque, he initially worked in the style that would be later defined as Analytic Cubism, known for its monochromatic color, use of linear grids, and breaking down of a subject into geometric planes. While he clearly had enormous respect for Picasso, the older man may have been threatened by the younger\\'s talents, or simply annoyed by his flattery, leading Stein to note that, \"Juan Gris was the only person whom Picasso wished away.\"Despite the lopsided nature of their relationship, his portrait of his mentor attracted the acclaim of fellow artists and critics when it was exhibited at the Salon des Independants in 1912. That same year, he signed a contract that gave the German art dealer Daniel-Henry Kahnweiler (who also worked with Picasso and Braque) the exclusive right to sell his work. After several years of financial difficulties in Paris, the arrangement gave him greater stability and allowed his work to reach a broader and more influential audience.Mature Period Though many recognized his talent in its own right, his work followed the austere monochromatic style of Analytic Cubism in the early 1910s, and moved in the direction of Synthetic Cubism - a subsequent phase, distinguished by a broader, bolder use of color and a collage-like approach to composition - from 1914 onward. Departing from Picasso and Braque somewhat, his work from the latter period is distinguished by its move away from shattering abstraction and use of bright, harmonious colors in daring combinations.As was the case for many artists of the time, the outbreak of World War I threw his personal and professional life into a state of flux. The war disrupted his business relationship with Kahnweiler, though he received financial help from Gertrude Stein. He also spent time with Matisse in his studio at Collioure, in the south of France near the Spanish border. In 1916, he signed a new contract with French art dealer Leonce Rosenberg, another hugely influential collector of modernist art. His work from the early war years examines the interplay between objects and their shadows, and reintroduces complicated planar intersections, sumptuous colors and textures.Toward the end of the war, he spent several months in Touraine, the native region of his French wife Josette. This period, unique in his art, focuses on depictions of traditional peasant figures, linking him to a broader shift among European artists during and after the war. Increasingly, these artists turned away from the avant-garde disruptions and reinterpretations of form that marked the early 1910s, and instead approached traditional techniques and subject matter with renewed interest that would persist throughout the remainder of his career.Though he experienced periods of illness and financial strife during the war years, his reputation was steadily rising. He was awarded his first major solo exhibition at Rosenberg\\'s Galerie l\\'Effort Moderne in Paris in 1919. The following year, he participated in the final major exhibition of Cubist painters at the Salon des Independants.Late Period He had been painting prolifically during and after the war, though in 1920 he became ill with pleurisy, a lung inflammation then often confused with tuberculosis. In an attempt to recuperate, he spent the winter at Bandol, on the southeastern coast of France. While there, he spent time with the Russian ballet impresario Sergei Diaghilev, and the two discussed ideas about staging and costumes for upcoming productions. Their conversations eventually yielded a full collaboration, with Gris designing costumes and sets for the Ballet Russes from 1922 to 1924.Major exhibitions of his work took place at the Galerie Simon in Paris and the Galerie Flechtheim in Berlin in 1923, and at the Galerie Flechtheim in Düsseldorf in 1925. It was during these years that he achieved the peak of popularity and renown that he would know in his lifetime. He was also making his most forceful articulation of his theories on art and aesthetics, delivering his lecture, \\'Des possibilites de la peinture\\' at the Sorbonne in 1924. In it, he describes his belief that a painting was not merely a representation of an object from reality, but something that the artist recreates and reinterprets through his craft.He was unable to bask in his successes for long, due to ongoing - and worsening - health problems. In 1922, he moved out of central Paris to the suburban area of Boulogne-sur-Seine, in the hopes that a quieter rural atmosphere would ease his chronic asthma. From late 1925 onward, he battled consistent kidney and cardiac ailments. He died in 1927 of kidney failure, leaving behind his wife and young son. He was only 40 years old. In response to Gris\\'s death, Stein wrote a memorial titled The Life and Death of Juan Gris, in which she describes him as \"a perfect painter.\"The Legacy of Juan Gris He established himself as one of the most distinctive figures in Cubism during his relatively short life. His paintings combine different viewpoints of a subject in one image, calling attention to the limitations of traditional perspective and striving toward a new way of seeing that reflects the complexity of the modern age. Though primarily associated with painting, Cubism also exerted a profound influence on 20th-century sculpture and architecture. The liberating formal concepts initiated by Cubism also had far-reaching consequences for Surrealism, Dada, and the rise of midcentury Abstract Expressionism. While Picasso and Braque are most often credited with creating the new visual language of Cubism, his distinctive interpretation of the style directly influenced artists such as Salvador Dalí, Joseph Cornell, and Diego Rivera, among many others. In The Secret Life, Dalí writes, \"my first cubist paintings... were directly and intentionally influenced by Juan Gris.\" His incorporation of brand logos and newspaper typography also anticipates the Pop art movement in the years following the Second World War, particularly in the works of artists such as Andy Warhol and Roy Lichtenstein.Influences and ConnectionsInfluences on ArtistInfluenced by ArtistArtists  Jean Metzinger    Robert Delaunay  Friends & Personal Connections  Pablo Picasso    Georges Braque    Henri Matisse  Movements & Ideas  Cubism  Artists  Joseph Cornell    Diego Rivera    Andy Warhol  Friends & Personal Connections  Salvador Dalí    Sergei Diaghilev  Movements & Ideas  Cubism    Surrealism    Abstract Expressionism    Pop Art  Open InfluencesClose InfluencesUseful Resources on Juan GrisBookswebsitesarticlesvideo clipsBooksThe books and articles below constitute a bibliography of the sources used in the writing of this page.
